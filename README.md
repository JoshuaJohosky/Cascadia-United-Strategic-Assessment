# Cascadia United: Strategic Feasibility \& Bioregional Governance

# A Data-Driven Evaluation of West Coast Sovereignty and Integration

# 

# I. Executive Summary



# This repository houses a comprehensive strategic assessment of the Cascadia United vision—the proposed integration of California, Oregon, and Washington into a sovereign or semi-sovereign bioregional entity. This research grounds the movement in a rigorous evaluation of regional economic, resource, and socio-political infrastructure.

# 

# II. Economic Power \& Global Standing



# The proposed region represents a global economic powerhouse:

# Population: Approximately 51.4 million residents.

# Nominal GDP: $5.29 trillion

# Global Rank: As an independent entity, this union would rank as the fourth-largest economy in the world, surpassing Japan and trailing only the remaining U.S., China, and Germany.

# 

# III. The Abundance Audit: Strategic Indicators



# This work systematically tests the proposition of regional self-reliance through quantitative resource audits:

# Food Security: Identifying the region as an agricultural superpower while mapping critical dependencies on foundational Midwest supply chains.

# Energy Independence: Analyzing clean energy leadership (hydroelectric and solar) against acute strategic vulnerability to petroleum imports.

# Water Sovereignty: Legal analysis of the Colorado River Compact and the Columbia River Treaty, demonstrating that true water sovereignty is constrained by complex external legal frameworks.

# 

# IV. Social Compact \& Strategic Pathways



# The assessment confronts the profound urban-rural political divide and demographic diversity that present significant barriers to regional unity. Strategic recommendations include:

# Shifting the mission from political secession to economic integration via regional compacts.

# Leveraging the region’s leadership as a “Green Superpower”.

# Developing a "Grand Bargain" to reinvest urban wealth into rural infrastructure and modernization.



# V. Academic Rigor



# This strategic analysis is supported by a bibliography of 134 academic and institutional sources, ensuring all conclusions are anchored in empirical data.
