# \# Cascadia United: Strategic Feasibility \& Bioregional Governance

# \*\*A Data-Driven Evaluation of West Coast Sovereignty and Integration\*\*

# 

# \## I. Executive Summary

# \[cite\_start]This repository houses a comprehensive strategic assessment of the \*\*Cascadia United\*\* vision—the proposed integration of California, Oregon, and Washington into a sovereign or semi-sovereign bioregional entity\[cite: 3, 493]. \[cite\_start]This research grounds the movement in a rigorous evaluation of regional economic, resource, and socio-political infrastructure\[cite: 44, 234].

# 

# \## II. Economic Power \& Global Standing

# The proposed region represents a global economic powerhouse:

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Population:\*\* Approximately 51.4 million residents\[cite: 7, 497].

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Nominal GDP:\*\* $5.29 trillion\[cite: 7, 497].

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Global Rank:\*\* As an independent entity, this union would rank as the \*\*fourth-largest economy in the world\*\*, surpassing Japan\[cite: 8, 498].

# 

# \## III. The Abundance Audit: Strategic Indicators

# This work systematically tests the proposition of regional self-reliance through quantitative resource audits:

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Food Security:\*\* Identifying Cascadia as a food powerhouse while mapping critical dependencies on foundational supply chains\[cite: 16, 126, 506].

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Energy Independence:\*\* Analyzing clean energy leadership (hydroelectric and solar) against acute strategic vulnerability to petroleum imports\[cite: 21, 134, 140, 513].

# \* \[cite\_start]\*\*Water Sovereignty:\*\* Legal analysis of the \*\*Colorado River Compact\*\* and the \*\*Columbia River Treaty\*\*, demonstrating that true water sovereignty is constrained by complex external legal frameworks\[cite: 26, 151, 152, 516].

# 

# \## IV. Social Compact \& Strategic Pathways

# \[cite\_start]The assessment confronts the profound \*\*urban-rural political divide\*\* and demographic diversity that present the most significant barriers to regional unity\[cite: 52, 242]. Strategic recommendations include:

# \* \[cite\_start]Shifting from political secession to \*\*economic integration\*\*\[cite: 37, 197, 527].

# \* \[cite\_start]Leveraging regional leadership as a \*\*“Green Superpower”\*\*\[cite: 37, 200, 527].

# \* \[cite\_start]Developing a "Grand Bargain" to reinvest urban wealth into rural infrastructure and modernization\[cite: 203, 204].

# 

# \## V. Academic Rigor

# \[cite\_start]Supported by a bibliography of \*\*134 academic and institutional sources\*\*\[cite: 39, 210, 529].
